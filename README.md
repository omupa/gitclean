# Git Clean

We clean branches from your git repository.

`Be careful, it doesn't ask for any confirmation outside the interative mode.`

## Interative mode

![gitclean-interative](./assets/example-interative.GIF)

## Delete all mode

![gitclean-delete-all](./assets/example-all.GIF)

## How to use

We provide executables for `linux/amd64` and `windows/amd64`. You can find then on the release page.

Download it and just run `./gitclean` inside your repository.

You can also add the executable to your `PATH` and you will be able to run gitclean from anywhere in
your shell.

## Asking for help

gitclean --help
```
